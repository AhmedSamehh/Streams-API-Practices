5) List of cities

   "Mumbai"
   "Munnar"
   "chennai"
   "Hyderabad"

   Calcullate the lenght of each city where the city name starts with 'm' or 'M' and create a list.


Can you  write a program to create another list that contains the cities start with "m"?


6)  I have to arrays
    int arr1[] = {21,6,8,9,10,5};
    int arr2[] = {10,21,5,8,6,9};

    write a program to check whether both arrays are equal or not.

7)  Given a string, find the words with the maximum number of vowels.

    	"The quick brown fox jumps right over the little lazy dog."
    	Maximum Number of Vowels: 2

    	output Words: quick, over, little  ( because each word has maximum of 2 vowels)


9) I have two sorted arrays. Need to merge those.


10) A List<String> contains alpha, numeric and alpha numeric values as strings. Write a program to create a List<Integer>s from the original List.

    	input :  List <String> ls =  ["as", "123", "32", "2as"]
    	output : List<Integer> iList = [123,32]


11) How to remove duplicates from an arrayList?

List of student
student - A - hindi - 50
student - A - maths - 90
student - A - science - 70

student - B - hindi - 80
student - B - maths - 90
student - B - science - 70
output - 
student a hindi 50 (least for student A)
student a maths 90 (hightest for student A)

student b scice 70 (least for student b)
student b maths 90 (hightest for student b)



14)

Left Rotate array :

input : 1 2 3 4 5 6
number: 3 -
output: 4 5 6 1 2 3




1)

Given 2 numbers as list, add the numbers and store the result in a new list.
2->3->5->7->NULL
8->2->7->NULL
Output : 3->1->8->4->NULL

   Input Array is: {15, 10, 16, 20, 8, 9, 7, 50 }

15 -16
   10 -16
   16-20
   20-50
   8-9
   9-50
   7-50
   50 -1

Find the next greatest element for each element in the Array.



3)


Given two arrays of integers, compute the pair of values (one value in each array) with the smallest (non-negative) difference. Return the difference.

Input : A[] = {l, 3, 15, 11, 2}
        B[] = {23, 127, 235, 19, 8}

Output : 3
the pair is: 11, 8
